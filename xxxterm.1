.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimalistic web browser that tries to stay out of the way so that
valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any
configuration.
It was written by hackers for hackers
and it strives to be small, compact, and fast.
.Pp
.Nm
is very simple in its use.
Most actions are initiated via key or mouse bindings.
Key bindings are based on those of the
.Xr vi 1
text editor,
giving web browsing a similar feel to navigating a text document.
The
.Sx KEY BINDINGS
section below documents the various defaults and possible customizations.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl S
Disable the toolbar.
.It Fl s Ar session_name
Open session that was saved with ":session save" command.
.It Fl T
Disable visualization of tabs.
.It Fl t
Disable tabs.
.It Fl n
Open a new tab in a running
.Nm
for each specified URL.
This option requires
.Cm enable_socket
to be enabled.
.It Fl V
Display version and exit.
.El
.Sh FAST STARTUP
The following notation is used throughout this page:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cm C
Control
.It Cm M
Meta (sometimes marked Alt)
.It Cm M1
Mouse button 1
.It Cm S
Shift
.El
.Pp
To browse to a specific address,
either use the mouse to click on the address bar
or press
.Cm F6
to shift the keyboard focus to the address bar.
The address is then entered manually.
.Pp
The mouse can be used to navigate the page in the traditional manner,
or the keyboard can be used instead.
For example,
.Cm PageUp
and
.Cm PageDown
will scroll up and down the page.
.Pp
To follow a link,
either click on it or use the
.Cm f
key and have
.Nm
assign numbers to each link on the page;
entering that number on the keyboard will prompt
.Nm
to follow the link.
.Sh KEY BINDINGS
.Nm
provides many actions accessed via key or mouse bindings.
Note that WebKit & GTK+ have their own set of key bindings
that are not overruled and therefore are available as-is.

.Sh WHITELISTS
.Nm
has a number of whitelists to control blocking cookies and Java Script
execution for FQDNs or domains.
When properly enabled these whitelists require either the FQDN or top level
domain to exist in the whitelists in order to allow cookies to be stored or
Java Script to execute.
Both Java Script and cookies have two whitelists associated with them.
The whitelists are called session and persistent.
Items in the session whitelists are only allowed for the lifetime of the
.Nm
instance.
Items in the persistent whitelists are stored on disk and are restored
upon restarting.
.Pp
Setting up the whitelists is a little tricky due to intricacies of WebKit.
In fact the semantics are different for cookies and Java Script.
.Pp
Cookie whitelist requires the following configuration to be set:
.Bl -tag -width "enable_cookie_whitelistXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm cookies_enabled
This is a WebKit setting and must be set to
.Pa 1 (ENABLED)
in order to be able to use a
cookie whitelist.
.It Cm enable_cookie_whitelist
This needs to be set to
.Pa 1
to enable the cookie whitelist functionality.
.It Cm cookie_wl
These entries in the configuration file are the actual domains names in the
cookie whitelist.
.El
.Pp
Java Script whitelist requires the following configuration to be set:
.Bl -tag -width "enable_js_whitelistXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm enable_scripts
This is a WebKit setting and must be set to
.Pa 0 (DISABLED)
in order to be able to use a
Java Script whitelist.
.It Cm enable_js_whitelist
This needs to be set to
.Pa 1
to enable the Java Script whitelist functionality.
.It Cm js_wl
These entries in the configuration file are the actual domains names in the
Java Script whitelist.
.El
.Pp
See the
.Pa FILES
section for additional configuration file entries and details
that alter runtime behavior.
.PP
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/xxxterm.confXXX" -compact
.It Pa ~/.xxxterm.conf
.Nm
user specific settings.
.It Pa ~/.xxxterm
.Nm
scratch directory.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
tries to open the user specific file,
.Pa ~/.xxxterm.conf .
If that file is unavailable,
it then uses built-in defaults.
.Pp
The format of the file is \*(Ltkeyword\*(Gt = \*(Ltsetting\*(Gt.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl http_proxy = http://127.0.0.1:8080
.Pp
Enabling or disabling an option is done by using 1 or 0 respectively.
.Pp
The file supports the following keywords:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "enable_cookie_whitelistXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm alias
Defines an alias for a given URL, so that the URL is loaded when the alias is
entered in the address bar.
If the aliased URL includes a %s format specifier, then any argument given after
the alias on the address bar is substituted.
For example, if g,http://www.google.com/search?q=%s is defined as an alias,
then the URL http://www.google.com/search?q=foo is loaded when navigating to
"g foo".
.It Cm allow_volatile_cookies
If set cookies are stored in the session cache but will be discarded once
.Nm
exits.
Unfortunately enabling this does allow for some limited tracking on the web.
.It Cm append_next
When set a new tab is appended after the current tab instead of being appended
as the last tab.
.It Cm cookie_policy
This field delineates the cookie policy.
Possible values are: no3rdparty, reject 3rd party cookies.
accept, accept all cookies.
reject, reject all cookies.
.It Cm cookie_wl

Valid entries are for example *.moo.com and the equivalent .moo.com.
A fully qualified host is also valid and is for example www.moo.com.
.It Cm cookies_enabled
Enable cookies.
.It Cm ctrl_click_focus
Give focus in newly created tab instead of opening it in the background.
.It Cm default_font_size
Set the default browsing font size.

.It Cm enable_plugins
Enable plugins.
.It Cm enable_scripts
Enable scripts.
.It Cm enable_socket
When enabled the first instance of
.Nm
will create a socket in the

.Nm
invocations will cause the specified URL to be loaded in a new tab.
Only a user with identical UID and GID can use this option.
.It Cm fancy_bar
Enables a backward, forward, and stop button to the toolbar.
Additionally if
.Cm search_string
is set it'll enable an entry box for searches.
.It Cm home
Homepage in URL format.
.It Cm http_proxy
Proxy server in URL format.
.Nm
overrides
.Cm http_proxy
if it is specified as an environment variable.
It must be noted that one MUST use an IP address and not a FQDN.
.Pp
If one desires to use a socks proxy then an intermediary tool must be used.
It has been reported that tsocks works with
.Nm .
.It Cm icon_size
Permits icon sizes to be changed if
.Cm fancy_bar
is enabled.
Size 1 is small; 2 is normal; 3 through 6 are progressively larger.
.It Cm js_wl
This is a Java Script whitelist item.
See
.Cm cookie_wl
for semantics and more details.
.It Cm mime_type
Sets an action for a specific or default MIME type.
For example, to download and view a pdf using kpdf set mime_type =
application/pdf,kpdf.
To set a default value use *, for example mime_type = video/*,mplayer.
Note that the action is only passed the URL and not all applications are
capable of downloading content and therefore one might have to create a wrapper
script to download the content first.
.It Cm read_only_cookies
Mark cookies file read-only and discard all cookies once the session is
terminated.
.It Cm refresh_interval
Refresh interval while in the download manager.
The default is 10.
.It Cm resource_dir
Directory that contains various
.Nm
resources such as icons.
This is OS-specific and should be handled by the porter.
.It Cm save_global_history
If set the global history will be saved to
.Pa ~/.xxxterm/history
when quitting
and restored at startup.
See the
.Sx KEY BINDINGS
section above for how the global history is accessed.
Global history is not saved to disk by default.
.It Cm save_rejected_cookies
Saves rejected cookies in cookie format in {work_dir}/rejected.txt.
All cookies are saved and unlike a cookie jar they are never replaced.
Make sure there is enough disk space to enable this feature.
.It Cm search_string
Default search engine string.
See the
.Pa xxxterm.conf
file for details.
.It Cm session_autosave
Enable session auto-saving when changing state (e.g. adding or removing a tab).

.Nm
will try to guess if the string you entered, in the URI entry widget or
the command widget, is term you want to search for using search_string
(see above). If the string does not contain a dot nor a slash, is not a
path to a local file and does not resolves to an IP then it is assumed
to be a search term.
.It Cm single_instance
If set only one
.Nm
will be permitted to run.
If there is a URL specified it will be opened in a new tab in the already
running
.Nm
session.
.It Cm ssl_ca_file
If set to a valid PEM file
all server certificates will be validated against it.
The URL bar will be colored green when the certificate is trusted
and yellow when untrusted.
.Pp
If
.Cm ssl_ca_file
is not set then the URL bar will color all HTTPS connections red.
.It Cm ssl_strict_certs
If this value is set connections to untrusted sites will be aborted.
This value is only used if
.Cm ssl_ca_file
is set.
.It Cm user_agent
Set to override the default
.Nm
user-agent string.
.It Cm window_height
Set the default height of the browser window.
.It Cm window_width

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was inspired by vimprobable2 and the bloat in other
.Ux
web browsers.

.Sh BUGS
When
.Cm save_global_history
is enabled
.Nm
is supposed to, in addition to restoring the global history, color the
visited links accordingly; however due to bug #51747 in WebKit this does
not happen.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimalistic web browser that tries to stay out of the way so that
valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any
configuration.
It was written by hackers for hackers
and it strives to be small, compact, and fast.
.Pp
.Nm
is very simple in its use.
Most actions are initiated via key or mouse bindings.
Key bindings are based on those of the
.Xr vi 1
text editor,
giving web browsing a similar feel to navigating a text document.
The
.Sx KEY BINDINGS
section below documents the various defaults and possible customizations.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl n
Open a new tab in a running
.Nm
for each specified URL.
This option requires
.Cm enable_socket
to be enabled.
.It Fl e Ar command
Execute arbitrary command (see the
.Sx COMMAND MODE
section below) in a running
.Nm
instance. This option requires
.Cm enable_socket
to be enabled. Example run: xombrero -e "tabnew openbsd.org"; xombrero -e
tabclose; xombrero -e wq.
.It Fl S
Disable the toolbar.
.It Fl s Ar session_name
Open session that was saved with ":session save" command.
.It Fl T
Disable visualization of tabs.
.It Fl t
Disable tabs.
Pages that would open in tabs open in new windows instead.
.It Fl V
Display version and exit.
.El
.Sh FAST STARTUP
The following notation is used throughout this page:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cm C-
Control
.It Cm S-
Shift
.It Cm M1-
Meta 1 (sometimes marked Alt)
.It Cm M2-
Meta 2
.It Cm M3-
Meta 3
.It Cm M4-
Meta 4 (sometimes marked Windows)
.It Cm M5-
Meta 2
.It Cm MB1
Mouse button 1
.El
.Pp
To browse to a specific address,
either use the mouse to click on the address bar
or press
.Cm F6
to shift the keyboard focus to the address bar.
The address is then entered manually.
.Pp
The mouse can be used to navigate the page in the traditional manner,
or the keyboard can be used instead.
For example,
.Cm PageUp
and
.Cm PageDown
will scroll up and down the page.
.Pp
To follow a link,
either click on it or use the
.Cm f
key and have
.Nm
assign numbers to each link on the page;
entering that number on the keyboard will prompt
.Nm
to follow the link.
.Sh KEY BINDINGS
.Nm
provides many actions accessed via key or mouse bindings.
Most can be reprogrammed using a
.Cm keybinding
entry in the configuration file.
Each keyboard shortcut requires exactly one entry in the configuration file.
A shortcut can have multiple entries in the configuration file.
The format of the keybinding entry is as follows:
.Pp
.D1 keybinding = (:)action,(!)keystroke(s)
.Pp
For example, "keybinding = tabnew,C-t" where
.Cm tabnew
is the action and
.Cm C-t
are
the keystrokes.
.Pp
Actions may be any xombrero command that can be run from the command
prompt.
There is one additional action,
.Cm unbind ,
which will unbind any previous actions to that keybinding.
.Pp
If the action begins with a colon, the action will be entered into the
command prompt instead of being executed.
For example, "keybinding = :session open ,M1-s" will open the command
prompt with ":open session " entered when using the M1-s keybinding.
.Pp
Keybindings which open the command prompt may also include the string
<uri>, which will be replaced by the current tab's URI.
For example, "keybinding = :open <uri>,F10" will open the command
prompt with <uri> replaced with the current URI.
.Pp
GTK has some default keybindings for manipulating text inside input
fields, such as the URI or search entry widget, for example
.Cm C-w
deletes a word. To override these defaults prefix your key with an
exclamation mark (!), like this: "keybinding = tabclose,!C-w".
The
.Cm clearall
key word is special and is meant to reset the key binding list to the GTK+
and WebKit defaults.
This keyword should be the first
.Cm keybinding
entry in the configuration file.
.Pp
Shift should be used sparingly since it gets in the way of non-USA keyboards.
See the accompanying configuration file for examples.
.Pp
The various bindings are documented below.
The relevant keybinding action is given afterwards, in parentheses.

.El
.Sh BUFFER COMMANDS
In addition to shortcuts and commands
.Nm
provides buffer commands. Buffer commands are short, multi character
vi-like commands, often requiring an argument. Partial buffer commands
are
displayed in the buffer command statusbar element (see
.Cm statusbar_elems ) .
Pressing Esc or switching to another tab cancels a partially entered
buffer command. In the following list
.Cm arg
denotes the argument a buffer command accepts. Buffer commands are
defined as extended regular expressions.
Note that if a character is used as a shortcut it will not be interpreted
as the beginning of a buffer command. This is the case with
.Cm 0 .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "['][a-zA-Z0-9]XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm gg
go to the top of the page

the last slash ('/') character and everything that follows it
.It Cm gU
go to the root level, i.e. going up as many levels as possible.
.It Cm gh
open the home page in the current tab
.It Cm m[a-zA-Z0-9]
set a mark denoted by
.Cm arg
at the current page position. These marks behave like those in vi or
less.

character (a letter or a digit), instead of a longer name. See the
.Cm M[a-zA-Z0-9] ,
.Cm go[a-zA-Z0-9]
and
.Cm gn[a-zA-Z0-9]
buffer commands for usage. Quickmarks are stored in
.Pa ~/.xombrero/quickmarks
and are saved automatically after each
.Cm M[a-zA-Z0-9]
buffer command.
.Sh ABOUT SCREENS
The about screens are internally generated web pages by
.Nm
for user interaction.
These are entered in the address bar and the format is
.Cm about:screen
where screen is the desired screen to display.

.Sh WHITELISTS
This section describes advanced usage settings.
Most users should use
.Cm browser_mode
instead to setup
.Nm
and skip over this section.
.Pp
.Nm
has a number of whitelists to control blocking cookies and JavaScript
execution for FQDNs or domains.
When properly enabled these whitelists require either the FQDN or top level
domain to exist in the whitelists in order to allow cookies to be stored or
JavaScript to execute.
Both JavaScript and cookies have two whitelists associated with them.
The whitelists are called session and persistent.
Items in the session whitelists are only allowed for the lifetime of the
.Nm
instance.
Items in the persistent whitelists are stored on disk and are restored
upon restarting.
.Pp
Setting up the whitelists is a little tricky due to intricacies of WebKit.
In fact the semantics are different for cookies and JavaScript.
.Pp
Cookie whitelist requires the following configuration to be set:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "enable_cookie_whitelistXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm cookies_enabled

Plugin whitelist requires the following configuration to be set:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "enable_plugin_whitelistXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm enable_plugins
This is a WebKit setting and must be set to

.It Cm enable_plugin_whitelist
This needs to be set to
.Pa 1
to enable the plugin whitelist functionality.
.It Cm pl_wl
These entries in the configuration file are the actual domains names in the
plugin whitelist.
.El
.Pp
See the
.Pa FILES
section for additional configuration file entries and details
that alter runtime behavior.
.Sh FILES

.El
.Pp
.Nm
tries to open the user specific file,
.Pa ~/.xombrero.conf .
If that file is unavailable,
it then uses built-in defaults.
Any settings saved at runtime will be saved to the file
.Pa ~/.xombrero/runtime
and will be loaded as well.
.Pp
The format of the file is \*(Ltkeyword\*(Gt = \*(Ltsetting\*(Gt.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl http_proxy = http://127.0.0.1:8080
.Pp
Enabling or disabling an option is done by using 1 or 0 respectively.
.Pp
The file supports the following keywords:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "enable_cookie_whitelistXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm alias
Defines an alias for a given URL, so that the URL is loaded when the alias is
entered in the address bar.
If the aliased URL includes a %s format specifier, then any argument given after
the alias on the address bar is substituted.
For example, if g,http://www.google.com/search?q=%s is defined as an alias,
then the URL http://www.google.com/search?q=foo is loaded when navigating to
"g foo".
.It Cm allow_insecure_content
If set, all content referenced by a page will be loaded.
If unset, encrypted pages will refuse to load content that is linked
from an insecure location.
.It Cm allow_insecure_scripts
If set, all scripts referenced by a page will be loaded and run using
the current javascript policy.
If unset, encrypted pages will refuse to run scripts that are linked
from an insecure location.
.It Cm allow_volatile_cookies
If set cookies are stored in the session cache but will be discarded once
.Nm
exits.
Unfortunately enabling this does allow for some limited tracking on the web.
.It Cm anonymize_headers
If set, HTTP headers taken from the
.Lk https://www.bitrig.org/ "Bitrig website"
will be used to feed additional values to the
.Nm xombrero
HTTP header settings.
Currently only the User-Agent and Http-Accept headers are modified,
corresponding to the
.Cm user_agent
and
.Cm http_accept
settings, respectively.
These headers are set after any header settings are read in from your
.Cm ~/.xombrero.conf .
Default is 0.
.It Cm append_next
When set a new tab is appended after the current tab instead of being appended
as the last tab.
.It Cm auto_load_images
If disabled, images will not be loaded automatically.
.It Cm autofocus_onload
When set a tab that is loaded will attempt to autofocus the default input
entry.
This is only done for tabs that are currently visible.
.It Cm browser_mode
The
.Nm
browser has 3 default operating modes:
.Pa normal
(the default),
.Pa whitelist
and
.Pa kiosk .
In the
.Pa normal
mode the browser allows all cookies, plugins and JavaScript as any other
browser would.
This means that all cookies are saved to persistent storage and that all
JavaScript and plugins run.
.Pp
On the other hand, using the
.Pa whitelist
mode enables whitelists.
This requires the user to add all the required
.Pa cookie_wl ,
.Pa js_wl
and
.Pa pl_wl
items.
If a domain does not appear in the whitelists
.Nm
disallows cookies, JavaScript and plugin execution.
If insecure web content or scripts are referenced by a secure website,
they will be blocked from loading or running.
.Pp
In
.Pa kiosk
mode the browse works just like
.Pa normal
mode however the toolbar only has the backward, forward and home button.
.Pp
This setting must be the first entry in
.Pa ~/.xombrero.conf
because it sets advanced settings that can be overridden later in the file.
See the default config file for more details.
.It Cm cmd_alias
This setting is used to define an alias for a command.
The syntax of this setting is
.Pa cmd_alias = alias,cmd .
For example, if you wanted to set an alias for the
.Pa tabnew
command to
.Pa tn ,
add the line
.Pa cmd_alias = tn,tabnew
to your
.Pa ~/.xombrero.conf .
This setting may not begin with a number.
.It Cm cmd_font
Set the command prompt font.
E.g.
.Pa cmd_font = monospace normal 9 .
.It Cm color_visited_uris
When enabled (the default)
.Nm
will color visited links. This is done while the web page loads using
JavaScript, rather than WebKit's (broken, see bug #51747) built-in
facility for coloring visited links. The JavaScript approach is
(probably) slower and is not consistent across tabs (unless the tabs are
reloaded), but has the advantage of not leaking history data to web
pages (see http://wtikay.com/docs/details.html).
.It Cm cookie_policy
This field delineates the cookie policy.
Possible values are: no3rdparty, reject 3rd party cookies.
accept, accept all cookies.
reject, reject all cookies.
.It Cm cookie_wl
This is a cookie whitelist item.
Use multiple times to add multiple entries.
Valid entries are for example *.moo.com and the equivalent .moo.com.
This matches both moo.com, as well as all subdomains.
A fully qualified host is also valid and is for example www.moo.com or
moo.com.
Fully qualified hosts do not modify whitelist settings for any
subdomains.
.Pp
Unix extended regular expressions may also be used to match any set of
FQDNs.
Regular expressions must begin with the prefix "re:".
As an example, the regular expression equivalent to moo.com would be
.Pa ^moo\.com$ ,
and the equivalent to .moo.com would be
.Pa ^(.*\.)*moo\.com$ .
If using regular expressions for whitelist items, be careful to not
accidentally match other domains;
you will almost always want to add the ^ and $ characters to the
beginning and end of the regex so that, for example,
.Pa moo\.com
would not match not-moo.com.
.It Cm cookies_enabled
Enable cookies.
.It Cm ctrl_click_focus
Give focus in newly created tab instead of opening it in the background.
.It Cm custom_uri
This setting provides the ability to run custom executables for
special URIs.
The syntax for this setting is
.Pa custom_uri\ =\ protocol,command .
The URI is passed as a single argument to
.Pa command
to be parsed and executed.
.Pp
For example, to add the ability to use custom
.Pa mailto
URIs, add the setting
.Pa custom_uri = mailto,command
where
.Pa command
is a program that will parse the
.Pa mailto
URI and open your mail client.
.It Cm default_script
Path to the script used as the default value for the run_script
command.
.It Cm default_zoom_level
Set the default browsing zoom level.
.It Cm do_not_track
Sets the HTTP Do Not Track header to tell sites that you wish to be
opted-out of 3rd-party tracking for the use of behavioral advertising.
Not all sites currently support this header, and this is only a
suggestion of a user preference.
Sites may still perform 3rd-party tracking even when this feature is
enabled.
.It Cm download_dir
Locations where files are downloaded to.
This directory must exist and
.Nm
validates that during startup.
.It Cm download_mode
Controls how downloads are handled.
Possible values are:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
start - automatically start download.
ask   - ask user for confirmation.
add   - add to downloadmanager, but
        do not start.
.Ed
The default is "start".
.It Cm download_notifications
When enabled a message is shown when downloads are finished.
Default is 0.
.It Cm enable_autoscroll
When enabled clicking MB3 will spawn the autoscroll ball, scrolling can
then proceed by dragging the mouse away from the ball.
.It Cm enable_cookie_whitelist
When enabled all cookies must be in the whitelist or they are rejected.
Additionally whitelisted cookies also enable HTML5 local storage for the
domain.
.It Cm enable_cache
When enabled (disabled by default), web content will be cached into
memory.
.It Cm enable_favicon_entry
When enabled (the default)
.Nm
displays the favicon of the web page at the URI entry. This setting
affects both
.Cm normal
and
.Cm compact
tabs.
.It Cm enable_favicon_tabs
When enabled (disabled by default)
.Nm
displays favicons at each tab. This setting only affects
.Cm compact
tabs.
.It Cm enable_js_autorun
Enables support for autorunning JavaScript after page loads.  When
enabled,
.Pa ~/.xombrero/js/
will be searched for
.Pa default.js
and
.Pa host.domain.js .
If
.Pa host.domain.js
does not exist,
.Pa domain.js
will be tried instead.  The content of the both default and
host/domain files are read and executed on each page load.
Default is 1.
.Pp
As an example, if you add the line
.Pa alert("Hello, world");
to your
.Pa default.js ,
a pop-up displaying "Hello, world" will be shown on every page reload.
While not useful, any javascript can be run through this mechanism,
making it useful for global or site-specific modifications.
.It Cm enable_js_whitelist
When enabled all domains must be in the js whitelist in order to run Java
Script.
NOTE: Make sure
.Cm enable_scripts
is set to 0.
.It Cm enable_plugin_whitelist
When enabled all domains must be in the plugin whitelist in order to run
plugins.
NOTE: Make sure
.Cm enable_plugins
is set to 0.
.It Cm enable_plugins
Enable external plugins such as Flash and Java.
.It Cm enable_strict_transport
Enable support for the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP-header.
When enabled, sites that set this flag will only be visited via HTTPS.
Default value is 1
.It Cm enable_scripts
Enable Java Script.
.It Cm enable_socket
When enabled the first instance of
.Nm
will create a socket in the
.Pa ~/.xombrero
directory.
Using the -n url option on subsequent
.Nm
invocations will cause the specified URL to be loaded in a new tab.
Only a user with identical UID and GID can use this option.
.It Cm enable_localstorage
Enable html5 Local Storage.
.It Cm enable_spell_checking
Enables spell checking. Preferred languages can be set using
.Cm spell_check_languages
option.
.It Cm encoding
Set the default encoding.
E.g.
.Pa encoding = ISO-8859-1 .
.It Cm external_editor
Set which editor to use for external editing.
the string <file> will be replaced by the current filename.
E.g.
.Pa external_editor = gvim -f <file>
Note!
.Cm xombrero
relies on the editor
.Pa not forking
into the background.
.It Cm fancy_bar
Enables a backward, forward, and stop button to the toolbar.
Additionally if
.Cm search_string
is set it'll enable an entry box for searches.
.It Cm force_https
This setting is used to define the domains of sites that should be
only accessed over the HTTPS scheme.
Any requests to these domains over HTTP will be rewritten to use HTTPS
instead.
See
.Cm cookie_wl
for semantics.
.It Cm gnutls_priority_string
If set, this string sets the G_TLS_GNUTLS_PRIORITY environmental
variable to define the GnuTLS priority string that is used when
initializing the GnuTLS session.
This may be used to change the supported TLS/SSL versions and the
ciphers that are used when making HTTPS connections.
.Pp
Full details on how to modify this setting may be found in the GnuTLS
documentation, Section 8.9: Priority Strings.
For example, to disable the 128-bit RC4 cipher, change this setting to
.Pa NORMAL:!ARCFOUR-128 .
.Pp
If your glib-networking package is older than version 2.33.10, or if
the G_TLS_GNUTLS_PRIORITY environmental variable is already set, this
setting has no effect.
.It Cm guess_search
When enabled
.Nm
will try to guess if the string you entered, in the URI entry widget or
the command widget, is term you want to search for using search_string
(see above).
If the string does not contain a dot nor a slash, is not a
path to a local file and does not resolves to an IP then it is assumed
to be a search term.
.It Cm gui_mode
To simplify configuring
.Nm
allows you pick between two GUI modes:
.Pa classic
(the default) and
.Pa minimal .
In the
.Pa classic
mode the GUI looks similar to that of most mainstream browsers. While in
.Pa minimal
mode the GUI looks more vi-like. One can get a GUI between the two by
tweaking the low-level GUI settings found under the advanced GUI setting
section in the configuration file.
.It Cm history_autosave
When enabled
.Nm
will save all command and search history.
Upon restarting
.Nm
the saved command and search history will be restored.
.It Cm home
Homepage in URL format.
.It Cm http_proxy
Proxy server in URL format.
.Nm
overrides
.Cm http_proxy
if it is specified as an environment variable.
It must be noted that on older Webkit versions one MUST use an IP address and
not a FQDN.
This works as expected with Webkit 1.4.2.
.Pp
If using libsoup 2.42.2 or newer, one may use a socks proxy directly.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http_proxy = socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
.Ed
Otherwise, an intermediary tool, such as polipo or tsocks, must be used.
.It Cm http_accept
If set, the HTTP Accept header will be modified for each text/html request.
If this setting is set multiple times, the Accept header will be changed
in a round-robin order for every text/html request on a tab.
Because this setting rotates through Accept headers on each text/html
request, a single page may rotate through more than one Accept header
if multiple text/html requests are made.
.Pp
Please be aware that not all websites report browser headers correctly.
Most notably, EFF's panopticlick service also reports the HTTP
Accept-Encoding headers on the same line as the Accept headers.
If you are trying to find the headers of another browser to model that
browser's fingerprint, it is recommended to not use panopticlick for
this reason.
.Pp
Note that this setting only rewrites the Accept header for text/html
requests.  Other requests will use WebKit's default  Accept header.
.It Cm http_proxy_starts_enabled
If set to 0, the http_proxy will be disabled at startup. The user can later
enable the proxy with the
.Cm proxy toggle
command or keybinding.
.It Cm icon_size
Permits icon sizes to be changed if
.Cm fancy_bar
is enabled.
Size 1 is small; 2 is normal; 3 through 6 are progressively larger.
.It Cm include_config
This must be a path to another configuration file.
Configuration files are usually read from top to bottom, however, if
this option is set,
.Nm
will begin reading the included file at this location and continue
reading the rest of the configuration after the included file has
finished being read.
.Pp
Any simple settings set before the include may
be overridden by settings in the included file, and any simple
settings set in the included file may be overridden later by settings
after the include or at runtime using the
.Cm :set
command.
However, database settings (for example,
.Cm cookie_wl , js_wl , pl_wl ,
and
.Cm keybinding )
are only ever added to the database, and so the order of an included
configuration file is not pertinent to these database settings.
.Pp
This feature is likely best used as the last item in
.Pa ~/.xombrero.conf .
.It Cm js_auto_open_windows
If enabled, javascripts will be allowed to automatically open windows
based on the current
.Cm browser_mode .
If disabled, it will never be allowed.  The default setting is 1 (enabled).
.It Cm js_wl
This is a JavaScript whitelist item.
See
.Cm cookie_wl
for semantics and more details.
.It Cm max_connections
The maximum number of connections that
.Nm
can open at once.
.It Cm max_host_connections
The maximum number of connections that
.Nm
can open at once to a given host.
.It Cm mime_type
Sets an action for a specific or default MIME type.
For example, to download and view a pdf using kpdf set
.Pa mime_type = application/pdf,kpdf .
To set a default value use *, for example,
.Pa mime_type = video/*,mplayer .
Note that the action is only passed the URL and not all applications are
capable of dealing with a URL and therefore one might have to create a wrapper
script to download the content first.  Alternatively one can add the
.Pa @
in front of the MIME type to indicate "download first".
For example,
.Pa mime_type = @application/pdf,xpdf .
When
.Pa @
is use the file will be downloaded to the
.Pa download_dir
before the MIME handler is called.
.Pp
The special binary name "donothing" may be used to ignore a MIME type
without displaying any warnings from being unable to execute the
binary.
.It Cm oops_font
Set the font used to display error messages.
E.g.
.Pa oops_font = monospace normal 9 .
.It Cm pl_wl
This is a plugin whitelist item.
See
.Cm cookie_wl
for semantics and more details.
.It Cm preload_strict_transport
If enabled, a preloaded list of sites which set the HTTP Strict
Transport Security header will be used to automatically set the
.Cm force_https
setting for these sites.
This is used to prevent SSL stripping attacks when first visiting
these sites, before they have been added to the strict-transport file.
This list is comprised of domains chosen by the
.Nm
authors, as well as domains included in Chromium's preloaded HSTS
list.
Default is 1.
.It Cm read_only_cookies
Mark cookies file read-only and discard all cookies once the session is
terminated.
.It Cm refresh_interval
Refresh interval while in the download manager.
The default is 10.
.It Cm referer
Control how
.Dq referer
is handled in http-requests.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
always      - always send referer
never       - never send referer
same-domain - only send referer if it's
              for the same public suffix - this means that
              it's OK for subdomains to refer to each other
same-fqdn   - only send referer if it's FQDN match
.Ed
Any other value that is also a valid URL will use this
custom value as referer. (E.g. you could set it to http://no-referer.com)
The default value is
.Dq always .
.It Cm resource_dir
Directory that contains various
.Nm
resources such as icons.
This is OS-specific and should be handled by the porter.
.It Cm save_global_history
If set the global history will be saved to
.Pa ~/.xombrero/history
when quitting
and restored at startup.
See the
.Sx KEY BINDINGS
section above for how the global history is accessed.
Global history is not saved to disk by default.
.It Cm save_rejected_cookies
Saves rejected cookies in cookie format in {work_dir}/rejected.txt.
All cookies are saved and unlike a cookie jar they are never replaced.
Make sure there is enough disk space to enable this feature.
.It Cm search_string
Default search engine string.
See the
.Pa xombrero.conf
file for details.
.It Cm session_autosave
Enable session auto-saving when changing state (e.g. adding or removing a tab).
The session name is what is currently in use and is described in the
.Cm session save
and
.Cm session open
commands.
.It Cm session_timeout
This value is the time that is added in seconds to a session cookie.
.It Cm show_tabs
Enable or disable showing tabs.
.It Cm show_url
Enable or disable showing the url and toolbar.
.It Cm show_scrollbars
Enable or disable the showing of the horizontal and vertical scrollbars.
Disabling this setting requires GTK3.
.It Cm show_statusbar
Enable or disable showing the status bar.
.It Cm single_instance
If set and
.Cm enable_socket
is enabled only one
.Nm
will be permitted to run.
If there is a URL specified it will be opened in a new tab in the already
running
.Nm
session.
.It Cm spell_check_languages
The languages to be used for spell checking, separated by commas. For example,
en_US.
.It Cm ssl_ca_file
If set to a valid PEM file
all server certificates will be validated against it.
The URL bar will be colored green (or blue when saved) when the certificate is
trusted and yellow when untrusted.
.Pp
If
.Cm ssl_ca_file
is not set, the URL bar will be colored red if the certificate has not
been saved, or blue if it has been saved.
.Pp
WebKit only supports a single PEM file.
Many OS' or distributions have many PEM files.
One can simply concatenate all separate files into one large one.
E.g.
.Cm for i in `ls`; do cat $i >> cert.pem; done
and use the resulting cert.pem file as the input to
.Cm ssl_ca_file .
It is advisable to periodically recreate the cert.pem file.
.It Cm ssl_strict_certs
If this value is set connections to untrusted sites will be aborted.
This value is only used if
.Cm ssl_ca_file
is set.
.It Cm statusbar_elems
Define the components of the status bar. The possible components are:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
| - separator
P - page progress percent
p - proxy enabled/disabled
B - buffer command
Z - page zoom level
T - current tab number
.Ed
The default is "BP".
These components show nothing if there is nothing worth showing, like
zoom amount 100%.
.It Cm statusbar_font
Set the status bar font.
E.g.
.Pa statusbar_font = monospace normal 9 .
.It Cm statusbar_style
Set the status bar style to either
.Cm url
- display the current url, or
.Cm title
- display the page title. The default is
.Cm url .
.It Cm tab_style
Set the tab style to either
.Cm normal
- the default gtk notebook tabs, or
.Cm compact
for an alternative.
You can switch the tab style with the
.Pa tabnextstyle
command.
.It Cm tabbar_font
Set the compact tab bar font.
E.g.
.Pa tabbar_font = monospace normal 9 .
.It Cm tabless
Disable tabs, and open new windows instead.
Note that this feature does not disable the display of tabs.
Change your
.Cm show_tabs
setting also if you wish to disable the display of tabs.
Default is 0.
.It Cm tab_elems
Define the components (and their order) of the gtk tabs. The possible components are:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
T - tab title
C - close button
S - spinner (incompatible with F)
F - favicon / spinner (incompatible with S)
.Ed
The default is "CTS".
.It Cm url_regex
This is the regular expression that is used to match what constitutes a valid
URL when using
.Pa guess_search .
.It Cm user_agent
Set to override the default
.Nm
user-agent string. May be specified several times for switching between
user-agents.
.It Cm userstyle
Set the stylesheet to be used as a default for the
.Cm userstyle
and
.Cm userstyle_global
commands when no extra parameters are given.
The default is a low-contrast stylesheet.
.It Cm userstyle_global
When enabled new tabs will automatically be displayed using the custom
stylesheet specified by the
.Cm userstyle
setting.
.It Cm warn_cert_changes
When enabled all SSL certificates from HTTPS websites will be
cached in the
.Cm ~/.xombrero/certs_cache/
directory.
On each page load, if the remote certificate differs from the cached
local version, a warning page with options of what to do next will be displayed
instead of the requested page.
This feature may be used in addition to the coloring of the URL bar and
can be used to help prevent against man-in-the-middle attacks, even if
the new remote certificate is signed by a trusted certificate
authority in
.Cm ssl_ca_file .
Default is 0.
.It Cm window_height
Set the default height of the browser window.
.It Cm window_width
Set the default width of the browser window.
.It Cm window_maximize
Maximize the browser window at startup.
.It Cm work_dir
Set the work directory where all
.Nm
scratch files are stored.
Default is
.Cm ~/.xombrero .
